# Changelog

## 1.2.6 - 2026-06-01

- Fixed Suno music tasks being marked completed before an audio URL was available.
- Added remote Suno task refresh through `/suno/fetch/{task_id}` so completed audio can be synchronized back to the node.
- Fixed music task records writing the wrong `nodeId`, which prevented task-list refresh from updating the source node.
- Fixed same-node Tianji/Seedance reruns so older completed tasks and previews no longer mirror the new task's running state.
- Improved the resources panel source filters with an all-sources view and clearer generated/external behavior.
- Made favorite models the node-side preferred default without reordering Settings model lists.
